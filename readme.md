# Custom Hooks in React:

## Custom Counter Hook:

Create a custom React hook called `useCustomCounter` that manages a counter state. The hook should expose functions to `increment`, `decrement`, and `reset` the counter. Implement a component that uses this custom hook to `display the counter` value and buttons to `perform the mentioned actions`.

## Form Validation Hook:

Build a custom React hook named `useFormValidation` that handles form validation for a simple form. The hook should take an `initial state` for the form fields and provide `functions` to update the `form state`, `perform validation`, and indicate whether the `form is valid`. Create a form component that utilizes this custom hook and `displays error messages` for invalid inputs.
